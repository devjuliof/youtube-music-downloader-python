### Usage

1. Open the script file and edit the `musicas` list with the titles of the songs you want to download:

    ```python
    musicas = [
        "Eduardo Costa - VÃª se volta comigo",
        "ZezÃ© de Camargo e Luciano - SerÃ¡ que foi saudade",
        # Add more songs here
    ]
    ```

2. Run the script in the terminal:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

The script will search for each song on YouTube, download the audio, and save it as an MP3 file.

---

### How It Works

1. The script searches for each title in the `musicas` list on YouTube.
2. It downloads the audio in high-quality MP3 format (192 kbps) and saves it with a formatted name based on the list.

---

### Notes

- The script saves the MP3 files in the same folder where it is executed.
- Ensure that FFmpeg is installed and configured correctly on your system.
